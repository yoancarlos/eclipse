		<description>When sender and receiver systems expect data in different formats and structure, then the data from sender needs to be transformed into the format and structure that the receiver can handle. This transformation is called mapping. The different types of mappings supported are:


Message Mapping 
Mapping is used for mapping messages when receiver system accepts a different message format than that of the sender system.

Operation Mapping 
Operation mapping is used when you require one or more mappings for request, response and fault payloads.

XSL Mapping
XSL Mapping is used when one XML structure is transformed into another XML structure. XSL Transformation (XSLT) is a member of the XML family of languages.

<context id="WriteVariable" title="Write Variables">
   <description>This flow element enables you to access same variable(s) across message(s) for same or different integration flows. It enables you to assign value to a variable by using constant, header, XPath, property, external parameter, defining an expression. The Global Scope checkbox allows you to use the variable across multiple integration flows.

a.	To assign a value using an XPath, select xpath in the Value Type column and enter the XPath expression in the Value column. 

Note 
•	The Data Type column is applicable for the “XPath” and “Expression” Value Type. The Data Type can be any Java class. An example of a data type for an XPath is java.lang.String.
•	If the XPath contains a namespace prefix, specify the association between the namespace and the prefix in the Runtime Configuration tab page of the integration flow Properties view.

b.	To assign a value using a header, select header in the Value Type column, and enter the header in the Value column. 

c.	To assign an external parameter, select external parameter in the Value Type column and define parameter key. For more details, refer to Externalizing Parameters of Integration Flow. 

d.	To assign a property, select property in the Value Type column. Properties are local variables. The scope of these variables limits to a specific message processing. For more details on properties, refer to Defining Content Modifier.</description>
