	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">During streaming the XML document is processed in parts or segments:  </p>

		<p class="p">The individual tags of an XML document are processed consecutively,irrespective of where in the
			overall structure the tag occurs and how often (multiplicity). This means that during
			the streaming process the converter cannot <cite class="cite">know</cite> if an element occurs in the
			structure more than once. In other words, during the streaming process the object model
			that reflects the overall structure of the XML document (and, therefore, also all
			information that can only be derived from the object model, like the multiplicity of
			elements) is not in place. This is different to the non-streaming case, where the
			converter can calculate the multiplicity of the XML elements from the object model of
			the complete XML document. The multiplicity is needed to create a correct JSON document.
			Elements whose multiplicity is greater than one must be transformed to a JSON member
			with an array. For example, you may think that for the XML document
				<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;root&gt;&lt;B&gt;b1&lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;b2&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/root&gt;</samp>,
			you create the JSON document <samp class="ph codeph">{“root”:{“B”:”b1”,”B”:”b2”}}</samp>. However,
			this JSON document is invalid, because the member name <samp class="ph codeph">“B”</samp> occurs twice
			on the same hierarchy level. </p>

		<p class="p">To ensure nevertheless a conversion that creates correct JSON documents during streaming, you
			need to either manually provide the information about which XML elements are multiple in
			advance, or decide that every XML element is converted to a JSON array (when configuring
			the converter in the Integration Designer).</p>

		<p class="p">To illustrate this behavior, let’s consider how the following simple XML structure has to be
			converted to JSON:</p>

		<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">&lt;root&gt;
  &lt;A&gt;a&lt;/A&gt;
  &lt;B&gt;b1&lt;/B&gt;
  &lt;B&gt;b2&lt;/B&gt;
  &lt;C&gt;c&lt;/C&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;</pre></div>

		<p class="p">Note that the element <samp class="ph codeph">root/B</samp> occurs twice (multiplicity = 2). </p>

		<p class="p">Without streaming, the converter would produce the following JSON structure:</p>

		<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">{"root":{"A":"a","B":["b1","b2"],"C":"c"}}</samp></p>

		<p class="p">As expected, the XML element <samp class="ph codeph">root/B</samp> would transform into a JSON member with an
			array as value, where the array has two values (<samp class="ph codeph">b1</samp> and
				<samp class="ph codeph">b2</samp>) – according to the multiplicity of <samp class="ph codeph">root/B</samp>.
			Note that a JSON array is indicated by the following type of brackets: [ … ].</p>

		<p class="p">With streaming with all elements to JSON arrays, the converter would produce the
			following JSON structure:</p>

		<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">{"root":[{"A":["a"],"B":["b1","b2"],"C":["c"]}]}</samp></p>

		<p class="p">All XML elements are transformed into members with a JSON array as value.</p>

		<p class="p">With streaming and specific elements as arrays (where root/A and root/B are specified),
			the converter would produce the following JSON structure: </p>

		<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">{"root":{"A":["a"],"B":["b1","b2"],"C":"c"}}</samp></p>

		<p class="p">An array is produced only for the XML elements root/A and root/B, but not for root/C. </p>

		<p class="p">With streaming and specific elements as arrays (where only root/A is specified), the
			converter would produce the following invalid JSON structure: </p>

		<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">{"root":{"A":["a"],"B":"b1",”B”:"b2","C":"c"}}</samp></p>
