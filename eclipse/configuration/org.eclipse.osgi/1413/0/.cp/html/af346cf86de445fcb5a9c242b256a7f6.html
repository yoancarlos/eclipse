                    <p class="p">Such steps might lead to resource shortages because long running transactions
                        can cause node instability and impede other processes that are running in
                        transactions.</p>

                    <p class="p">Some of the above mentioned steps or adapters persist data in the database.
                        In case of an error, the whole process is rolled back and the original state
                        is being re-established. That means, data from failed processes remain and,
                        in case message processing fails, customers normally cannot access data
                        about the failed processing (due to the roll-back). </p>

                    <p class="p">In case an error is propagated back to the calling component, all data that
                        have been written in the course of the (failed) transaction are being
                        removed (in other words: not persisted in the database). For the calling
                        component, an error implies, therefore, to restart the integration flow.  </p>

                    <p class="p">Transactional processing is also to be considered in scenarios that contain
                        asynchronous decoupling. Let’s assume integration flow A contains a Data
                        Store Operation step. Integration flow B contains a Select operation on the
                        Data Store and runs into an error. In that case, that data is preserved that
                        has been written to the database by integration flow A. This behavior makes
                        sense in particular when you consider the case that integration flow B
                        changes or deletes the data that has been stored by integration flow A. In
                        case integration flow B fails, the original data from integration flow A can
                        be retrieved.</p>
