		<div class="section"><p class="p">At design time of an
                integration project, the way how a message is to be processed is specified by a
                number of integration flow steps (for example, content modifier, encryptor or
                routing step). When an integration flow is being processed at runtime, errors can
                occur at several individual steps within the process flow (referred to as
                    <cite class="cite">processing steps</cite> to differentiate them from the integration flow
                steps as modelled at design time).</p>
<p class="p">Integration flow steps can specify message
                processing at different levels of complexity. Therefore, in general an integration
                flow step (design time) can result in multiple processing steps steps at runtime.
                </p>
<p class="p">Each processing step gets a unique <span class="ph uicontrol">Step ID</span> which is
                displayed in the message processing log. </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
                <p class="p">For example, a content modifier step in an integration flow model can (at
                    runtime) be related to multiple processing steps: The content modifier step can
                    be configured in a way that one processing step changes the message header, one
                    the message body, and another one an exchange property. </p>

            </div>
<p class="p">In order to enable the integration developer to relate a
                    <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">modelled</span> step to an error occurring at a certain processing
                steps, at runtime, the same identifier is assigned to each processing step that
                relates to the same integration flow step. This identifier is referred to as
                    <span class="ph uicontrol">Model Step ID</span>. </p>
<p class="p">The following figure illustrates
                this behavior for a content modifier step in an integration flow, where three
                different processing steps are related at runtime to the content modifier.
                </p>

                step during error handling, the runtime provides the Model Step ID of the
                integration flow step where the error occurred as Exchange Property:
                    <samp class="ph codeph">SAP_ErrorModelStepID</samp>. The content of the property can then be
                evaluated in the error handling. </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
                <p class="p">You can use the property for instance in a condition definition of a Router step
                    to choose a different error handling strategy depending on the step where the
                    error occurred. </p>

                <p class="p">Example for a routing condition : <samp class="ph codeph">${property.SAP_ErrorModelStepID} =
                        ‘CallActivity_1’</samp></p>

		<div class="section">
            <p class="p">When referring to an integration flow step for error handling, you need to know which
                Model Step ID has been defined for an integration flow step. To display this
                attribute, position the cursor on the step and in the tooltip you get the Model Step
                ID displayed as ID. To display this attribute for an adapter, position the cursor on
                the connection shape in the integration flow model and in the context menu choose
                    <span class="ph uicontrol">Technical Information</span>.</p>
