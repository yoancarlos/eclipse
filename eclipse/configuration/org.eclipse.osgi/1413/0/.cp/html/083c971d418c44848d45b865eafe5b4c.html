		<p class="p">When configuring integration flows, you are usually dealing with the following kinds of data
			representations: </p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Binary Data</div><div type="Binary Data">
			
			<p class="p">There is always some loss of data when binary data is converted into strings. You should
				therefore avoid converting pure binary data to strings.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Text Data</div><div type="Text Data">
			
			<p class="p">Text data can be represented in binary or string form. In order to convert string
				representation to binary representation and the other way round,, the desired (or
				existing) binary encoding needs to be known. </p>

			<p class="p">The integration framework uses the following scheme to determine the type of character
				encoding: </p>

			<ol class="ol" id="loio083c971d418c44848d45b865eafe5b4c__ol_rvs_kpn_tt">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">If the header <samp class="ph codeph">CamelCharsetName</samp> is set, the value of this header is used as
						the character encoding.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">If the exchange property <samp class="ph codeph">CamelCharsetName</samp> is set, the value of this
						exchange property is used as the character encoding. </p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">If neither the header nor the exchange property are defined, <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">UTF-8</span> is
						used as the character encoding. </p>

				</li>

			</ol>

			<p class="p">There is no universal way to determine the correct encoding for the data. However, for some
				communication protocols (such as mail or HTTP) this information may be transferred
				via the protocol header. </p>

			<p class="p">The integration developer needs to make sure that the character encoding that is defined by
				the header or exchange property and the binary content encoding are in sync.
				Otherwise, subtle, hard-to-solve issues can occur. These issues often aren't
				revealed by testing, as they  usually only occur with non-ASCII characters.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">XML Data Conversions</div><div type="XML Data Conversions"><p class="p">There are three type of representation for XML
				data: </p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio083c971d418c44848d45b865eafe5b4c__ul_lqm_xpn_tt">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Serialized binary representation of the XML document </p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Serialized string representation of the XML document </p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Parsed (binary) representation of the XML document </p>

					<p class="p">This representation is used for operations such as XPath or XSLT
						processing.</p>

				</li>

			</ul>
<p class="p">XML documents usually contain information about the character encoding in
				serialized form within the XML declaration (at the beginning of the XML document).
				</p>
<p class="p">However, note that this XML declaration is irrelevant if string
				representation is used for the document. If the XML document is parsed from or
				marshaled (serialized) to binary representation, the charset definition (and the
				byte order marker (BOM)) are used to determine the content encoding. </p>
<p class="p">If no
				encoding is defined, <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">UTF-8</span> is assumed (unless a BOM is present
				when it is UTF-16). </p>
<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
				<p class="p">The conversion between the parsed and the serialized form works fine without any
					configuration and has a mechanism to determine and use the correct character set
					for the conversion. However, issues can occur when converting directly between
					the two serialized forms (binary and string). This conversion is not
					XML-specific and uses the scheme for text data. This conversion will actually
					damage the content of the document if the character encoding used in Camel does
					not match the character encoding used in the XML document.</p>

				<p class="p">The following figure illustrates this.</p>

			</div>
<img class="image" id="loio083c971d418c44848d45b865eafe5b4c__image_fgw_tqn_tt" src="loioc9f2cbacfb3e406aa090ecb715bdf1eb_LowRes.png"/><p class="p">If
				a conversion between binary XML and parsed XML takes place, the encoding that is
				defined in the XML declaration is used as the character encoding in the XML
				document. If it is converted to a string first, the encoding defined in the
					<samp class="ph codeph">CamelCharsetName</samp> header or property is used. If these values do
				not match, conversion via a string might break the document. </p>
<p class="p">Conversions
				between binary and string (highlighted in the figure) generally require attention
				from the integration developer because there is no generic way to determine the
				character encoding of the binary text or XML content (and the integration developer
				must be sure to set the correct value there). </p>
<p class="p">XSLT sheets can change the
				content encoding of the XML document if they convert XML to XML. In this case, the
				output encoding will either be defined by the XSLT or it will be UTF-8, even if the
				input document has a different encoding. If direct binary-to-string conversion takes
				place before and after the XSLT, the integration developer has to make sure that the
					<samp class="ph codeph">CamelCharsetName</samp> property or header is defined
				appropriately.</p>
